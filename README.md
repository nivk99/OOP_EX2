# Weighted and Directed graph 
A weighted directed graph  is represented as a list of (vertex-edgelist) pairs, where the pairs are in standard order , the edgelist is a list of (neighbor-weight) pair also in standard order, every weight is a nonnegative integer, and every neighbor appears as a vertex even if it has no neighbors itself."
A common operation on weighted (directed) graphs is the shortest-path computation; the determination of the path(s) from two nodes A and B such that the sum of the weights of the vertices on the path is minimal

## What is a graph?
Graph is a structure amounting to a set of objects in which some pairs of the objects are in some sense "related". The objects correspond to mathematical abstractions called vertices (also called nodes or points) and each of the related pairs of vertices is called an edge (also called link or line). Typically, a graph is depicted in diagrammatic form as a set of dots or circles for the vertices, joined by lines or curves for the edges. The edges may be directed or undirected.

## What does directed graph mean?
Directed graph is an ordered pair G = (V, E) where
V is a set whose elements are called vertices, nodes, or points;
E is a set of ordered pairs of vertices, called arcs, directed edges , arrows, or directed lines.
It differs from an ordinary or undirected graph, in that the latter is defined in terms of unordered pairs of vertices, which are usually called edges, links or lines.

## What does Weighted graph mean?
A weighted graph or a network is a graph in which a number (the weight) is assigned to each edge. Such weights might represent for example costs, lengths or capacities, depending on the problem at hand. Such graphs arise in many contexts, for example in shortest path problems such as the traveling salesman problem.
