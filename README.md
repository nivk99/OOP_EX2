# Directed graph

## What does directed graph mean?
Directed graph is an ordered pair G = (V, E) where
V is a set whose elements are called vertices, nodes, or points;
E is a set of ordered pairs of vertices, called arcs, directed edges , arrows, or directed lines.
It differs from an ordinary or undirected graph, in that the latter is defined in terms of unordered pairs of vertices, which are usually called edges, links or lines.

## What does Weighted graph mean?
A weighted graph or a network is a graph in which a number (the weight) is assigned to each edge. Such weights might represent for example costs, lengths or capacities, depending on the problem at hand. Such graphs arise in many contexts, for example in shortest path problems such as the traveling salesman problem.
