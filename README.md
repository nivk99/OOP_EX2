# Directed graph

## What does directed graph mean?
Directed graph is an ordered pair G = (V, E) where
V is a set whose elements are called vertices, nodes, or points;
E is a set of ordered pairs of vertices, called arcs, directed edges , arrows, or directed lines.
It differs from an ordinary or undirected graph, in that the latter is defined in terms of unordered pairs of vertices, which are usually called edges, links or lines.
